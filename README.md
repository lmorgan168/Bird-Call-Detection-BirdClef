# Bird-Call-Detection-BirdClef

## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a neural network that can classify rare and endangered bird species based on audio recordings. We are focused on improving the monitoring of these species through automated detection of their calls. Given limited data, our model aims to classify the presence or absence of a specified bird's call at 5-second intervals within 1-minute audio recordings.
